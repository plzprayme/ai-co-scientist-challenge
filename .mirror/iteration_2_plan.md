# Iteration 2 Planning

**Based on Iteration 1 Evaluation (Score: 91/100)**

---

## Priority Improvements

### HIGH Priority (Must Fix)

**1. Add Architecture Diagram**
- Visual representation of the three-branch architecture
- Show data flow through the system
- Include Bayesian optimization loop

**2. Quantify Computational Requirements**
- GPU memory for ensemble training
- Training time estimates
- Storage requirements for datasets
- DFT calculation cost estimates

**3. Statistical Analysis Plan**
- Exact test for significance (paired t-test, α=0.05)
- Confidence intervals for metrics
- Cross-validation strategy
- Effect size calculations

### MEDIUM Priority (Should Fix)

**4. Fidelity Correlation Validation**
- Pre-experiment analysis to confirm low/med/high fidelity correlation
- What if correlation is weak? Mitigation strategy
- Scatter plots showing R² between fidelities

**5. Enhanced Differentiation**
- More explicit comparison to prior multi-fidelity work
- Novel contribution of three-component combination
- Advantages over existing approaches

## Iteration 2 Goals

1. **Improve Score:** Target ≥ 95/100
2. **Add Missing Components:** Architecture diagram, computational requirements
3. **Strengthen Methodology:** Statistical rigor, validation plans
4. **Enhance Novelty:** Better differentiation from prior work

---

## Execution Plan

1. Generate architecture diagram (ASCII or description)
2. Add computational requirements section
3. Implement statistical analysis plan
4. Conduct fidelity correlation analysis
5. Re-evaluate and continue

**Start:** Now
**Expected Duration:** 10-15 minutes
**Next:** Iteration 3 if score < 99
